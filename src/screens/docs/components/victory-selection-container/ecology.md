# VictorySelectionContainer

`VictorySelectionContainer` is used to enable selecting data points within a highlighted region.
Clicking and dragging will select an x-y region, and add the `active` prop to any elements
corresponding to data points within the region. Create a select-box control by tying the set of
selected data points to other elements, such as filtered table.

`VictorySelectionContainer` is similar to `VictoryBrushContainer`. `VictoryBrushContainer` may be
used to identify the domain of a selected region, whereas `VictorySelectionContainer` may be used to
identify a list of data points within a selected region. `VictoryBrushContainer` will also create
persistent highlighted regions, whereas regions created by `VictorySelectionContainer`
disappear after `onMouseUp` events.

`VictorySelectionContainer` may be used with any Victory component that works with an x-y coordinate
system, and should be added as the `containerComponent` of the top-level component.
However, the component that uses it must be standalone
(`standalone={true}`), which is the default for all top-level Victory components.

```playground
<VictoryChart containerComponent={<VictorySelectionContainer/>}>
  <VictoryScatter
    style={{ data: { fill: (d, active) => active ? "tomato" : "gray" } }}
  />
</VictoryChart>
```

## Props

`VictorySelectionContainer` uses a superset of props used by [VictoryContainer]. All props are optional.

### dimension

When the `dimension` prop is set, the selection will only take the given dimension into account.
For example, when `dimension` is set to "x", the selected area will cover the entire y domain
regardless of mouse position.

*example:* `dimension="x"`

### selectionStyle

The `selectionStyle` prop should be given as an object of style attributes to be applied to the
`selectionComponent`

*default:* `selectionStyle={{stroke: "transparent", fill: "black", fillOpacity: 0.1}}`

### selectionComponent

The `selectionComponent` prop specifies the element to be rendered for the selected area. When
this prop is not specified, a `<rect/>` will be rendered. This component will be supplied with the
following props: `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and `style`.

*default:* `selectionComponent={<rect/>}`

### onSelection

The `onSelection` prop accepts a function to be called whenever new data points are selected. The
function is called with the parameters `points` (an array of objects with `childName`, `eventKey`,
and `data`) and `bounds` (an object with min / max arrays specified for `x` and `y`).

*example:* `onSelection={(points, bounds) => handleSelection(points, bounds)}`

### onSelectionCleared

The `onSelectionCleared` prop accepts a function to be called whenever the selection is cleared.

*example:* `onSelectionCleared={() => handleSelectionCleared()}`

## Standard Container Props

### style

The `style` prop defines the style of the container, and should be given as an object of SVG style attributes.
The `width` and `height` should be specified via props instead of style attributes as they determine
relative layout for components.

*example:* `style={{border: "1px solid #ccc"}}`

*default (provided by default theme):* VictoryTheme.grayscale. See [VictoryTheme] for more detail.

### responsive

The `responsive` prop specifies whether the rendered container should be a responsive container with a `viewBox` attribute, or a static container with absolute width and height.

*default:* `responsive={true}`

### width and height

The `width` and `height` props determine the width and height of the containing `<svg>`. By default VictoryContainer renders responsive containers with the `viewBox` attribute set to `viewBox="0, 0, width, height"` and `width="100%"`, `height="auto"`. In responsive containers, the `width` and `height` props affect the _aspect ratio_ of the rendered component, while the absolute width and height are determined by the container. To render a static container, set `responsive={false}`

*example:* `width={350}`

### events

The `events` prop attaches arbitrary event handlers to the container element. This prop should be
given as an object of event names and corresponding [React event handlers]. Events defined directly
via this prop will be masked by `defaultEvents` on `VictorySelectionContainer` (`onMouseDown`,
`onMouseUp`, and `onMouseMove`), and by any events defined through Victory's event
system that target parent elements.

*example:* `events={{onClick: (evt) => alert("x: " + evt.clientX)}}`

### title

The `title` prop specifies the title to be applied to the SVG to assist with accessibility for screen readers. The more descriptive this title is, the more useful it will be for people using screen readers

*example:* `title="Popularity of Dog Breeds by Percentage"`

### desc

The `desc` prop specifies the description of the chart/SVG to assist with accessibility for screen readers. The more descriptive this title is, the more useful it will be for people using screen readers.

*example:* `desc="Golden retreivers make up 30%, Labs make up 25%, and other dog breeds are not represented above 5% each."`

### portalComponent

The `portalComponent` prop takes a component instance which will be used as a container for children that should render inside a top-level container so that they will always appear above other elements. [VictoryTooltip] renders inside a portal so that tooltips always render above data. [VictoryPortal] is used to define elements that should render in the portal container. This prop defaults to [Portal], and should only be overridden when changing rendered elements from SVG to another type of element _e.g.,_ [react-native-svg] elements.

*default:* `portalComponent={<Portal/>}`

### theme

The `theme` prop specifies a theme to use for determining styles and layout props for a
component. Any styles or props defined in `theme` may be overridden by props specified on the
component instance. By default, components use a [grayscale theme]. [Read more about themes here].

*example:* `theme={VictoryTheme.material}`

### onTouchStart (native only)

The optional `onTouchStart` prop takes a function that is called on every touch event on the chart (when using `victory-native`). The most common use of `onTouchStart` is to prevent the chart's parent `ScrollView` from scrolling, so that the chart and container can be interacted with unencumbered. The function accepts a single parameter, `event`, a React Native [Synthetic Event]. Also see `onTouchEnd`.

*example:*

```jsx
<ScrollView scrollEnabled={this.state.scrollEnabled}>
  <VictoryChart
    containerComponent={
      <VictoryContainer
        onTouchStart={() => this.setState({ scrollEnabled: false })}
        onTouchEnd={() => this.setState({ scrollEnabled: true })}
      />
    }
  >
   <VictoryBar/>
  </VictoryChart>
</ScrollView>
```

### onTouchEnd (native only)

The optional `onTouchEnd` prop takes a function that is called at the conclusion of every touch event on the chart (when using `victory-native`). The most common use of `onTouchEnd` is to prevent the chart's parent `ScrollView` from scrolling, so that the chart and container can be interacted with unencumbered. The function accepts a single parameter, `event`, a React Native [Synthetic Event]. Also see `onTouchStart`.
